//# Two Repeated Elements

/*
You are given an array of N+2 integer elements. All elements of the array are in the range 1 to N. Also,Â 
all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers.

Note: Return the numbers in their order of appearing twice. So, if X and Y are the repeating 
numbers, and X repeats twice before Y repeating twice, then the order should be (X, Y).
