//# Missing element of AP

/*
Find the missing element from an ordered array arr[], consisting of N elements representing an Arithmetic Progression(AP).

Note:Â There always exists an element which upon inserting into sequence forms Arithmetic progression. Boundary elements 
(first and last elements) are not missing.
