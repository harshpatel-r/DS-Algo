//# Find Index

/*
Given an unsorted array Arr[] of N integers and a Key which is present in 
 this array. You need to write a program to find the start index( index 
 where the element is first found from left in the array ) and end 
 index( index where the element is first found from right in the array)
 .If the key does not exist in the array then return -1Â for both start 
 and end index in this case.
